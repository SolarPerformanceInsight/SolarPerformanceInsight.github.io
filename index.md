# Solar Performance Insight

The Solar Performance Insight is an open source tool to enable evaluations of solar power plant performance.

Registered users may log in to the tool at [app.solarperformanceinsight.org](https://app.solarperformanceinsight.org).
To register, sign the [user agreement](/assets/UArizona_Data_Use_Agreement_Power_Modeling.pdf) and return it to [admin@solarperformanceinsight.org](mailto:admin@solarperformanceinsight.org).
The SPI administrators will then create a unique user account for you.

[Sign up](/emaillist/) to recieve project updates by email.

Members of the solar community are invited to join the [Stakeholder Committee](/stakeholdercommittee) to
 provide guidance on project development.

# Project Goals

Our project will build a performance modeling and analytics platform based on open-source, extensible,
community-maintained code. The project will benefit to the solar community through two primary outcomes:
-  Extending [pvlib-python](https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python) to easily model PV systems with greater detail.
-  Deliver modeling capabilities through a web-based dashboard and an API.
We work directly with industry stakeholders to validate user stories, derive use cases and analytic requirements,
and test the platform.

# Project Background and Motivation

A common task in PV Operations and Maintenance (O&M) is to compare actual performance over a period of time
with modeled performance. Available asset management platforms that provide performance analytics are often
far larger in scope than many O&M contractors need or can be tied to proprietary data acquisition systems.
These platforms can be unaffordable for O&M providers with smaller portfolios or impractical for portfolios
with diverse data systems. Consequently, O&M service engineers typically adapt their workflows to the available
modeling tools which are primarily designed to predict future performance, rather than model past performance.

# Project News

We are beta-testing the Solar Performance Insight tool, and are eager to hear
your feedback and comments. See above for instructions to get your own account.

Feedback can be emailed to [info@solarperformanceinsight.org](mailto:info@solarperformanceinsight.org), or join the development
community at [https://github.com/SolarPerformanceInsight/solarperformanceinsight](https://github.com/SolarPerformanceInsight/solarperformanceinsight).

# Funding
