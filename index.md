# Solar Performance Insight

This performance modeling and analytics platform is based on open-source, extensible, community-maintained code. 
The project benefits the solar community through two primary outcomes.

Registered users may log in to the tool at [app.solarperformanceinsight.org](https://app.solarperformanceinsight.org).
To register send a message to [techsupport@solarunitedneighbors.org](mailto:techsupport@solarunitedneighbors.org).
The SPI administrators will then create a unique user account for you.

Members of the solar community are invited to join the [Stakeholder Committee](/stakeholdercommittee) to
 provide guidance on project development.

# Project Goals

Our project will build a performance modeling and analytics platform based on open-source, extensible,
community-maintained code. The project will benefit to the solar community through two primary outcomes:
-  Extending [pvlib-python](https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python) to easily model PV systems with greater detail.
-  Deliver modeling capabilities through a web-based dashboard and an API.
We work directly with industry stakeholders to validate user stories, derive use cases and analytic requirements,
and test the platform.

# Project Background and Motivation

A common task in PV Operations and Maintenance (O&M) is to compare actual performance over a period of time
with modeled performance. Available asset management platforms that provide performance analytics are often
far larger in scope than many O&M contractors need or can be tied to proprietary data acquisition systems.
These platforms can be unaffordable for O&M providers with smaller portfolios or impractical for portfolios
with diverse data systems. Consequently, O&M service engineers typically adapt their workflows to the available
modeling tools which are primarily designed to predict future performance, rather than model past performance.

# Project News

The Solar Performance Insight tool is live and available for public use. We are eager to hear your feedback and comments. 
See above for instructions to get your own account.

Feedback can be emailed to [techsupport@solarunitedneighbors.org](mailto:techsupport@solarunitedneighbors.org), or join the development
