# Purpose and Summary

This document presents use cases and their associated requirements. To avoid repeating requirements,
 a use case may adopt, expand, or modify the requirements of another use case. These cases are derived
 from User Stories extracted from interviews and communications with solar O&M industry professionals
 (system owners, engineers, asset managers, and O&M providers). The SPI Project Team identified these
 particular use cases based on the frequency with which they appeared in user stories and consistency
 with the scope of the award that funds this work. The following use cases are addressed:

1. Calculate Performance
2. Compare Performance
3. Disaggregate Sources of Observed Performance
4. Evaluate Equipment Sensors

Framework functional requirements are capabilities not specific to a use case but which the framework
 requires in order to satisfy the use cases. The following framework functional capabilities are developed:
5. Provide performance model
6. Import assumptions used in original modeling
7. Import weather data from various sources
8. Import snow/soiling data
9. Import actual system performance data
10. Import  data from on-site sensors
11. Import irradiance data
12. Administer the framework
13. Archive data


## Calculate Performance
