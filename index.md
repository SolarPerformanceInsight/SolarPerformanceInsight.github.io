# Solar Performance Insight

The Solar Performance Insight is an open source tool to enable evaluations of solar power plant performance.

Our project will work directly with industry stakeholders to validate user stories, derive use cases and analytic requirements, and test the platform. Members of the solar community are invited to join the [Stakeholder Committee](/stakeholdercommittee) to provide guidance on project development.

# Project Goals

A common task in PV Operations and Maintenance (O&M) is to compare expected system performance with actual performance
over a period of time. Currently, O&M service engineers must adapt their workflows to the available modeling tools which
are primarily designed to predict future performance, rather than model past performance.

Our project will build a performance modeling and analytics platform based on open-source, extensible, community-maintained code. The project will benefit to the solar community through two primary outcomes:
-	Extending [pvlib-python](https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python) to easily model PV systems with greater detail.
-	Deliver modeling capabilities through a web-based dashboard and an API.

# Funding
See the [funding page](/funding) for more information on the project's funding from the U.S. Department of Energy's Solar Energy Technology Office.
