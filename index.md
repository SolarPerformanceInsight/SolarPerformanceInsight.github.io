# Solar Performance Insight

The Solar Performance Insight is an open source tool to enable evaluations of solar power plant performance.

See the [funding page](funding) for more information on the project's DOE SETO funding.

We continue to seek members of the solar community to provide guidance on project development. Please see our [Stakeholder Committee](/stakeholdercommittee) page for more information on how you can join the committee and help guide the project development.
