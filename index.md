# Solar Performance Insight

The Solar Performance Insight is an open source tool to enable evaluations of solar power plant performance.

[Sign up](https://solarperformanceinsight.github.io/emaillist/) to recieve project updates by email.

Members of the solar community are invited to join the [Stakeholder Committee](/stakeholdercommittee) to
 provide guidance on project development.

# Project Goals

Our project will build a performance modeling and analytics platform based on open-source, extensible,
community-maintained code. The project will benefit to the solar community through two primary outcomes:
-  Extending [pvlib-python](https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python) to easily model PV systems with greater detail.
-  Deliver modeling capabilities through a web-based dashboard and an API.
We work directly with industry stakeholders to validate user stories, derive use cases and analytic requirements,
and test the platform.

# Project Background and Motivation

A common task in PV Operations and Maintenance (O&M) is to compare actual performance over a period of time
with modeled performance. Available asset management platforms that provide performance analytics are often
far larger in scope than many O&M contractors need or can be tied to proprietary data acquisition systems.
These platforms can be unaffordable for O&M providers with smaller portfolios or impractical for portfolios
with diverse data systems. Consequently, O&M service engineers typically adapt their workflows to the available
modeling tools which are primarily designed to predict future performance, rather than model past performance.

# Project News

We have published use cases to guide project development. The [use cases](/usecases) were compiled from input from O&M
providers, asset owners and managers, and other PV professionals during a special session of SAMNA North America
(online, April 6-7, 2020) and from members of the [Amicus Solar Cooperative](https://www.amicussolar.com/). Priority
use cases include:
-  Calculate performance from actual weather with user-selected performance models.
-  Compare actual and modeled performance using performance ratios.
-  Account for snow and soiling in performance models.

In the coming months, the project team will build out capabilities in the [pvlib-python](https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python.git)
modeling library that support the use cases. The project team will also draft a business plan to ensure that the
modeling services are available to the industry after the project period has ended.
