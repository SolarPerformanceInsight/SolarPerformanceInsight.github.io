# Solar Performance Insight

The Solar Performance Insight is an open source tool to enable evaluations of solar power plant performance.

A common task in PV Operations and Maintenance (O&M) is to compare expected system performance with actual performance
over a period of time. The PV O&M service industry lacks an affordable, targeted, straightforward tool that can bring in
actual  performance data from multiple data acquisition systems (DAS) to perform this task. Consequently, O&M service
engineers must adapt their workflows to the available tools, spending needless hours coercing available tools to perform
the desired tasks, thereby increasing costs for O&M services.

See the [funding page](funding) for more information on the project's DOE SETO funding.

We continue to seek members of the solar community to provide guidance on project development. Please see our [Stakeholder Committee](/stakeholdercommittee) page for more information on how you can join the committee and help guide the project development.
